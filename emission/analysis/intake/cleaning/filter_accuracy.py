"""
Creates a filtered stream (filtered_location) from the original 
unfiltered stream. Used for clients that don't perform their own
filtering, such as ongoing data collection clients on android.
The high level algorithm is to:
  - filter out all entries with an accuracy higher than the threshold
  - filter out all entries that are identical to the entries that we have
    seen before
  - see whether we have already saved this entry. This is important for two reasons:
    - we don't want to generate duplicate entries in case the client provides us
        with a pre-filtered stream (as in the case of android with geofencing)
    - we want to ensure that this operation, just like all our other operations,
        is idempotent. That ensures that we can simply reset the pipeline state
        and re-run everything if we have any changes that we need to make.
